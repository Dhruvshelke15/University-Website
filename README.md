Welcome to a demo university website created by me and my group for certain projects.

This site features use of HTML, CSS, PHP anf JavaScript. MongoDB is used to handle database. Our website aims at improving the interface and making it more secure by introducing various ssl encryption techniques and by using an easy to understand layout for all the users.
