                    <p>Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. Finally we can change the world by educating. The roots of education are bitter but fruit is sweeter. A tree is nothing without its roots similarly, education without exams. Every child has a different learning style and pace. Each child is unique, not only capable of learning but also capable of succeeding. The understanding capacity of students can be judged with the help of their ‘Conceptual Knowledge’. Language plays a vital role in shaping one’s personality so do mathematical skills and scientific attitude. All the important subjects are being targeted to achieve the goal of competency. ‘Bloom’s Taxonomy’ parameters which develop the children to think and understand. I personally feel it is important for students.One has to develop the attitude of developing questions like ‘Why’ and ‘How’ to encourage his own learning skills. If the ‘Concepts’ are strong your subject knowledge , critical, creative thinking is strong. Now if you ask me  what we have achieved from these exams?. I would say developing Young Minds is developing a nation as followed by Dr. A.P.J. ABDUL KALAM.</p>

                    <p>As exams develop them as an individual, give values, extraordinary thinking, self assessment, overcome failures, filling them with positivity to improve the quality of education. Exams help every teacher to understand the mental capacity of the students and to rectify their shortcomings. In turn it helps the students to perform and think as the way it should be done. This Covid -19 pandemic has given us the opportunity to learn , relearn and unlearn at every circumstance. Even if exams are cancelled this time we need to create awareness that at each stage of life every exam of each grade is important and it is a continuous process a child has to go through the entire life. Exams are boring, but makes our mind caring, it always checks our base, but students don’t love it, as teachers judge it. We can know our real knowledge, and exam is just a part of testing the knowledge. Through exam, student knows their knowledge and compare to other students. Some of the students in the world, they have not a chance to know where their knowledge is. A student will having a war between their class mates because they compete with each other with their knowledge and exam is the ground at their they see who is the best among them. and due to exam, their compete with each other’s  and it might be generate interest and excitement on topic that not interest. And from the exam they can improve their confidence level, and level of knowledge.</p>
